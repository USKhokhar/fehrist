**Black Sheep by Rachel Harrison** is a horror novel about a cynical twentysomething named **Vesper Wright** who is forced to confront her unconventional family's dark secrets when she returns home for her cousin's wedding.

Vesper left her staunchly religious community at eighteen and never looked back. But when she receives an invitation to her cousin's wedding at the family farm, she feels compelled to attend, even though it means returning to the toxic environment she escaped.

Upon her return, Vesper discovers that her family is still deeply involved in the cult-like community, and that her mother, Constance, a former horror film star, is just as cold and calculating as ever. Vesper's homecoming also exhumes a terrifying secret from her past, one that forces her to reckon with her family's beliefs and her own crisis of faith.

Black Sheep is a deliciously sinister novel that explores the way family ties can bind us as we struggle to find our place in the world. It is a must-read for fans of horror, family drama, and anything else that goes bump in the night.
