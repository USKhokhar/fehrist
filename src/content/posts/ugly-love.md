Ugly Love by Colleen Hoover is a contemporary romance novel about Tate Collins, a registered nurse, and Miles Archer, an airline pilot. They meet when Tate moves into an apartment complex where Miles lives, and they are instantly drawn to each other. However, Miles is a man who has been deeply hurt in the past, and he is not interested in a serious relationship. He proposes a friends-with-benefits arrangement to Tate, with two rules: never ask about his past and don't expect a future.

Tate is initially hesitant, but she agrees to Miles's terms. They quickly develop a passionate physical relationship, but Tate soon finds herself falling in love with Miles. Despite her best efforts, she can't help but break the first rule and ask him about his past. Miles is furious, and he ends their arrangement.

Tate is heartbroken, but she doesn't give up on Miles. She eventually learns the truth about his past: his ex-girlfriend, Rachel, died in a tragic car accident, and he still blames himself for her death. Tate helps Miles to start healing, and they eventually rekindle their relationship.

However, their happiness is short-lived when Rachel's mother, Lisa, reappears in Miles's life. Lisa is claiming that Rachel is still alive, and she tries to convince Miles to leave Tate and be with Rachel. Miles is torn between his love for Tate and his guilt over Rachel's death.

In the end, Miles realizes that he must choose between the past and the present. He chooses Tate, and they finally get the happily ever after they deserve.

Ugly Love is a powerful and emotional story about love, loss, and forgiveness. It is a reminder that even the most damaged hearts can be healed.
