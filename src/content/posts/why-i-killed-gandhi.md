"Why I Killed Gandhi" is a contentious autobiographical account that delves into the motivations and reasoning behind the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the iconic leader of the Indian independence movement. The book, written by Nathuram Godse, provides a unique perspective on the events leading up to the assassination and the ideological differences that drove Godse to commit this heinous act.


In the book, Godse outlines his fundamental disagreements with Gandhi's methods and policies. A central point of contention is Gandhi's stance during the tumultuous period of India's partition, where he advocated for tolerance and cooperation between Hindus and Muslims. Godse, on the other hand, believed that Gandhi's approach favored Muslims at the expense of Hindus and the territorial integrity of India.


Through this autobiographical work, Godse attempts to rationalize his actions by presenting himself as a patriot deeply concerned about the interests of the Hindu community and the unity of India. He outlines his belief that the assassination was a necessary and justifiable act to protect what he saw as the best interests of the nation.


owever, it's crucial to approach "Why I Killed Gandhi" with a critical perspective. The book remains highly controversial due to its promotion of violence and the assassination of a figure known for his commitment to nonviolence and peaceful resistance. The historical and political context surrounding Gandhi's life and the complex issues related to India's independence movement should be considered when engaging with this book. Ultimately, the work has been widely condemned for its extreme perspective and divisive ideology.

In conclusion, "Why I Killed Gandhi" by Nathuram Godse is a deeply contentious autobiographical account that attempts to rationalize the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The book provides Godse's unique perspective on his ideological differences with Gandhi, particularly related to the partition of India and the treatment of the Hindu community. While it presents a viewpoint that sharply contradicts Gandhi's principles of nonviolence, it's important to approach this book with critical analysis, considering the historical and political context, and recognizing its highly divisive and controversial nature.
