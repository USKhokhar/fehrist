# Fehrist - Your Gateway to the Literary World 📚

**Fehrist** (فهرست) is more than just an open-source catalogue; it's a journey through the treasure trove of knowledge, an ode to the world of literature. The word "Fehrist" itself, originating from Arabic, means a "comprehensive and organized list." Just as the word suggests, this project aims to bring together a wealth of book synopses, creating a comprehensive and organized index of literary insights.
