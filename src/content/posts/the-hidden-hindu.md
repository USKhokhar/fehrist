**Synopsis of The Hidden Hindu by Akshat Gupta**

The Hidden Hindu is a science fiction thriller novel that seamlessly blends Indian mythology with modern-day science. The story begins in 2041, when a 21-year-old man named Prithvi sets out on a quest to find a mysterious Aghori (Shiva devotee) named Om Shastri. Om is said to have lived for thousands of years and has witnessed all four yugas (epochs) in Hinduism, including the events of the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

Prithvi's journey takes him to a remote research facility in the Andaman Islands, where Om is being held captive and interrogated by a team of scientists. The scientists are baffled by Om's claims of immortality and his knowledge of ancient events. They subject him to a battery of tests, but none of them can prove that he is lying.

As Prithvi gets closer to Om, he begins to learn more about his incredible past. Om reveals that he is one of a group of immortals who have been living in secret for centuries. He also tells Prithvi that a great cataclysm is coming, and that the immortals must unite to prevent it.

Meanwhile, the scientists at the research facility are starting to believe Om's story. They realize that he is a living encyclopedia of ancient knowledge, and that his insights could revolutionize science and history. But as they learn more about Om, they also discover that he is not the only immortal in the world. There are others, with their own agendas and motivations.

As the story progresses, Prithvi and Om find themselves caught in a web of intrigue and danger.
