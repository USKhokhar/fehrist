# J Sai Deepak's "India, That Is Bharat: Coloniality, Civilisation, Constitution"

## Unveiling the Impact of Colonialism

In his groundbreaking work, J Sai Deepak dives into the profound impact of European colonialism on Bharat, the successor state to the Indic civilization. Beyond politics and economics, Deepak explores the cultural and epistemological dimensions of coloniality, arguing that it continues to shape Indian society and culture.

### Coloniality and Christian Worldview

Deepak delves into the concept of coloniality, connecting it to the Christian worldview. He contends that coloniality is a system rooted in justifying the dominance of non-Western peoples, an idea ingrained in the belief of Western superiority derived from the Christian worldview. Conversion, often accompanied by violence, becomes a duty in this framework.

### Enlightenment Project's Role

Examining the relationship between coloniality and the Enlightenment project, Deepak highlights how the emphasis on reason, individualism, and secularism contributed to the development of colonial thought. The rational and orderly view of the world, a product of the Enlightenment, justified European colonization of non-Western lands.

### Coloniality's Impact on Indian Society

Deepak scrutinizes the deep impact of coloniality on Indian culture, education, and institutions. The imposition of the English language and Western-style education by the British colonial government led to a decline in Indian languages and cultural knowledge. The education system prioritized loyalty to the British Empire over critical thinking and creativity.

### Indian Constitution and Colonial Legacy

Deepak explores the reflections of coloniality in the Indian Constitution, pointing out how principles like secularism may not align with the Indic worldview that integrates religion into life. He critiques the Western model of democracy embedded in the Constitution, suggesting it contradicts the Indian ethos of consensus and cooperation.

### Decolonization and Reclamation of Indigenous Traditions

In his call for decolonization, Deepak emphasizes not a rejection of Western knowledge but a critical awareness of its limitations. He advocates for the revitalization of India's indigenous traditions, urging a return to the Indic worldview with its emphasis on dharma, karma, and moksha. The revival of traditional Indian education and institutions becomes a crucial part of this decolonial journey.
